Posts into r/ModSupport:
This community is a place to ask questions you have regarding moderation on Reddit and discuss answers with other moderators. All posts are monitored by Redditâ€™s admins, who will flair posts once questions are appropriately answered by other mods or respond to posts that can benefit from admin clarification. In addition, we have a bot that removes posts from non-moderators, as this space is reserved for support for moderators.

Post your question into when you have a question about mod tools or are seeking general advice on your subreddit.

Examples of topics that violate subreddit rules and will be removed:

Rule 1: Rule violations, questions about specific admin actions, and appeals (e.g. account and banned subreddit appeals, report responses for content reported to the Safety team)

You can modmail for admin support on these topics.

Rule 2: Calling out other users or subreddits

Rule 3: Not being civil toward others

Rule 4: Off-topic posts that are not related to moderation on Reddit

Please post all bugs into r/bugs and choose the appropriate flair - Mod Tools - iOS, Mod Tools - Android, Mod Tools - Desktop or Mod Tools - Mobile Web.

Bug Reporting best practices include:

Description: 1-3 sentences on the issue.

Platform and version: web or mobile + version (for ex: 2022.23.1).

Steps to reproduce: what actions do you take to experience the bug?

Expected and actual result: What did you experience and what do you think you should experience instead?
